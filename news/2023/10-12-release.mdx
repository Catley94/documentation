> **`Info`** : Now, package update for WMs will not replace your modified configs (previously, backing-up your configs in `~/.config`).
> Instead, It'll install new updates in separate directory (eg: `~/.config/openbox_pacnew_2023-10-12`), It'll be your choice to use your current config or updated one.
> You can use `meld` to merge updates in your current modified configs.
